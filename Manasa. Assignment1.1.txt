1.Say True or False forthe below statements:

. Prescriptive Analytics used to predict the future outcomes? Yes

. Base R packages installed automatically? Yes

2. What is Recycling of elements in a vector?

When applying an operation to two vectors that requires them to be the same lenghth, R automaticaaly recycles, or repeats the shorter one.

3. Give an example of ercycling of elements.
 
> c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) + c(1,3)
[1] 2 5 4 7 6
Warning message:
In c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) + c(1, 3) :
  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length

 As you can see, the c(1, 3) vector repeated itself to form (1,3,1,3,1,3) so that it could  successfully match the previous term.

 If the shorter vector is not a vector of the longer one, then warning message appears, but the operation still takes place.
